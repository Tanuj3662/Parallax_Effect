      <h1>What is parallax scrolling?</h1>
      <p>
        Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website
        background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a
        3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and
        creating a more immersive browsing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives
        objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we
        perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different
        mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional
        animation, dating back to as early as Disneyâ€™s Snow White and the Seven
        Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario.{" "}
